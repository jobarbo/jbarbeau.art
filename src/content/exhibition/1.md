Hi everyone, my art will be exhibited at @brasserielakorrigane this summer ðŸ™‚. Itâ€™s my first exhibition in the real world and Iâ€™m really happy for this opportunity. The collection launch will be this Thursday May 18th at the venue at 5pm. Come check it out if youâ€™re in the neighborhood, Iâ€™ll be happy to ramble about generative art all evening ðŸ˜….
