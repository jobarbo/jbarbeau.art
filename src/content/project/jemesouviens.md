  'Je me souviens' is a hauntingly evocative exploration of memory, impermanence, and the passage of time. Rooted in the spirit of nostalgia and loss, the collection captures the echoes of what once was — decayed cityscapes, fragmented structures, and spectral presences that linger like afterimages in the mind.


  Each piece delves into the interplay between presence and absence, revealing the liminal spaces where history fades and the remnants of the past whisper their stories. The title, drawn from the iconic Québecois motto, transcends its origin to embody a universal reflection on collective and personal memory — what we carry forward, what we leave behind, and what persists despite the erasure of time.


  Through its glitch-like textures and layered compositions, 'Je me souviens' invites viewers to reflect on their own connections to place, memory, and the inevitable transformation of all things.


  ||==INSPIRATION==||


  This piece was inspired by the fragility of human civilization and the fleeting traces we leave behind. Influenced by themes of erosion and memory, it explores how time transforms our biggest achievement into mere echoes, leaving behind empty shells of what once was.


  This series is the culmination of over a year of dedicated research and study into texture creation, utilizing particle systems and Perlin noise as a way to convey the essence of disintegration and loss.
