					<p>
						As a child, I developed a keen interest in science and the wonders of the natural world, although artistic
						pursuits didn't come naturally to me. Due to struggles with my handwriting, drawing wasn't a significant
						part of my childhood. However, everything changed when I made the decision to learn coding in my
						mid-twenties. During my college years, I had a exploratory course that gave student freedom in what they
						wanted to learn, allowing me to explore any subject within the realm of computer science and web
						development. Intrigued by the HTML5 canvas, a tool whose purpose remained elusive to us at the time, I
						delved into its study.
					</p>
					<p>
						his exploration led me to the captivating realm of Generative Art, which beautifully blends science, art,
						and design. Instantly captivated, I became deeply immersed in this field and officially began creating and
						sharing my artwork on Instagram in 2018. Initially, it served as a personal exercise to foster a habit of
						creation instead of consumption. Little did I anticipate that my creations would resonate emotionally and
						visually with others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Motivated by my deep need for exploration, learning and the need for self-expression, I use Javascript to
						delve into mathematical, scientific, aesthetic, and emotional concepts. Through my work, I often merge the
						laws of order and the chaos of anarchy—two contrasting forces that intriguingly coexist in the natural
						world. By incorporating a touch of randomness, each new generative piece brings excitement, as I never know
						exactly what the outcome will be.
